## How the game works
1. A turtle moves forwards when you press the "Up" key. It can only move forwards, not back, left or right.
2. Cars are randomly generated along the y-axis and will move from the right edge of the screen to the left edge.
3. When the turtle reaches at the other end, you pass the level and +1 in your scoreboard
4. Each level passes, the car's movement speed and the number of car created will increase

## Steps on how I make this game
A few things that are required in this game are:
* Step 1: Move the turtle with keypress
* Step 2: Create and move cars horizontally and randomly
* Step 3: Detect the collision with car
* Step 4: Detect turtle when reaching the other side
* Step 5: Create scoreboard

###### I created this game in Pycharm instead VSCode.
